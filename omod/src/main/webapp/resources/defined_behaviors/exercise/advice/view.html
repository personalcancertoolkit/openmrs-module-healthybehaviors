            Adults should do strengthening activities, like push-ups, sit-ups, and lifting weights up to 4 days a week, allowing for a day of rest after muscle strengthening.
            Exercises for each muscle group should be repeated 8 to 12 times per set. As exercises become easier, increase the weight or do another set.
            <Br>  <Br>
            Strengthening activities should include all the major muscle groups - legs, hips, back, chest, stomach, shoulders, and arms. These activities include, but are not limited to: lifting weights, push-ups, sit-uips, and working with resistance bands.
